It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.
As far as I'm concerned, I see People, I see passion,
I feel complicty. 
You made us gather around this greater goal, ande we're all 
assembled to make that happen. I'm having fun again.

I know this: we're going to be old friends till we're old 
and senile, and then, we'll be new friends every day again ;-)
Did I tell you I love you? There! I said it.
